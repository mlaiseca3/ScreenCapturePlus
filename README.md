This project aims to be evolve into a screen capturing utility that is used from the browser with features like screen capture to PNG, screen capture to PDF, minor editing of screen capture pictures, screen capture to GIF recording, and OCR from screen capture images. 

This code uses the [Screen Capture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API/Using_Screen_Capture#examples)

Not sure how to use OCR in browser yet but maybe we can use something like [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js). Check their [GitHub pretrained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models)

TODO
- screenshot exports to PNG
- screenshot exports to PDF
- screen capture to GIF
- OCR for screen capture images to text output
